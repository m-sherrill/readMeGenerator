  # Read Me Generator
  
  ## Description

A node.js app using Inquirer. The user will be provided with a series of prompts to fill in information for their README file. Not all prompts are required, this application will leave off areas which were left blank during input. 

## Installation

- This application requires node.js. Make sure this is installed on your computer first.
- Clone this repository to your computer. 
- Open the index.js file in your terminal and run ```npm install```. This will install inquirer to your folder. 
- Once Inquirer is installed, run ```node index.js``` and answer the prompts.
- All prompts that are *not* required, are stated as the prompts are presented.
